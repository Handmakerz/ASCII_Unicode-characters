# ASCII_Unicode-characters

A reference of character sets. These are useful for my study path and ideas to build upon. 
Still trying to figure out more about this subject so I can use in future projects. These 
are the basics that I picked up to start this journey. Due to this subject their will be more updates.

Until next time >quote: "The Adventure." ;-}
